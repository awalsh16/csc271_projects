    <h3>Welcome to the website!</h3>
    <br><p>This website is used to share <strong>slang and common phrases</strong> in various languages!</p>
    <p>Commonly, people only study the regular phrases and words that are used academically, but this website focusses on what people <em>normally</em> say.</p>
    <p>I have created this website because I studied foreign languages and have gone to the target country, but still fell flat in basic conversations.</p>
    <br><br><p>This website will have the following pages:</p><ul>
        <li>User Forum</li>
        <li>Phrase of the day</li>
        <li>Slang & phrase bank</li>
    </ul>
